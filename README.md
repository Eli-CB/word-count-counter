# Word Counter
[Demo Link](https://word-counter-five.vercel.app/ "Word Counter Demo")

An app that counts the occurences of each word entered in the text box.

## Running the Application

In order to run the application locally, please follow the following instructions:

1. `git clone` the repository
2. `cd` into the `word-count` directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Wait for your browser to open or nagivate to `localhost:3000`

### Assumptions Made During Development:

1. Text would be entered manually, text file submission not supported.
2. Word counts would not update dynamically, the `Count Words` button must be pressed to see the word counts.
